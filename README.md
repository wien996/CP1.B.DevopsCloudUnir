# Repo para EU - DevOps&Cloud - UNIR

This repository includes a simple project to demonstrate the concepts of unit testing, service testing, use of Wiremock and performance testing. The aim is for the student to understand these concepts, so the code and structure of the project is particularly simple. This project also serves as a code source for the Jenkins pipeline.
